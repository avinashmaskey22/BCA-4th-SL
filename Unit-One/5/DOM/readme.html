        Document Object Model (DOM):
        -> When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
        -> The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects. (refer to figure)
        -> With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:
            - JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
            - JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
            - JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
            - JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
            - JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
            - JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
            - JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

        So, What is DOM?
        -> The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.
        -> The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:
            "The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."
        -> The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:
            - Core DOM - standard model for all document types
            - XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
            - HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents

        What is the HTML DOM?
         -> The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. 
         -> It defines:
            - The HTML elements as objects
            - The properties of all HTML elements
            - The methods to access all HTML elements
            - The events for all HTML elements
         -> In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.

         Finding HTML Elements (Methods):
         -> document.getElementById(id): Find an element by element id
         -> document.getElementsByTagName(name): Find elements by tag name
         -> document.getElementsByClassName(name): Find elements by class name

        Changing HTML Elements (Properties):
         -> "element.innerHTML =  new html content" (Change the inner HTML of an element)
         -> "element.setAttribute(attribute, value)" (Change the attribute value of an HTML element)
         -> "element.style.property = new style" (Change the style of an HTML element)
