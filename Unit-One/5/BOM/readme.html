       Browser Object Model (BOM):
        - BOM refers to the objects provided by the browser that allow interaction with the browser window itself. Unlike the Document Object Model (DOM), which deals with the structure of a web page, the BOM allows for interaction with the browser environment, such as the window, location, history, and more.

        - The window object is the global object representing the browser's window or tab. It contains properties and methods that allow you to control and interact with the window itself.
