 - An event is an action that occurs as per the user's instruction as 
   input and gives the output in response.
 
 - Events are things that happen in the system you are programming, 
   which the system tells you about so your code can react to them.

 - For example, if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to react 
   to that action by displaying an information box.
